            In this first task, we have included two charts from the Richard Davies Library. The first chart illustrates the positive correlation between economic development and life expectancy, using cross-country data. The second chart showcases the evolution of inflation in four G7 economies from 2000 to 2023.

            a large but needed property market correction, and structural headwinds such as weakening productivity and labor force growth.
