    <h2> PP 434 Project: Why it is hard to reduce labour informality in Peru? </h2>
    
            <p> 
            <b>Aims:</b> The project aims to (i) visually scale the problem of labour informality in Peru by comparing it with other Latin American countries, and (ii) explore its causes through the analysis of household surveys and regional-level data.

            <h2> Peru's labour informality is one of the highest in Latin America </h2>
            <p> 
            Based on data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) for 19 Latin American countries, Peru stands out as one of the countries with the highest labor informality rate. Approximately 71.6% of workers in Peru are employed under informal conditions – not contributing to social protection systems – a figure that exceeds the Latin American average (51.8%) by almost 20 percentage points.
            </p>

        </div>

            <p>
            Labour informality is a significant problem for developing economies because it leads to a misallocation of resources to low-productivity activities, erodes government tax revenues and limits the broader coverage of social protection systems. The following scatter plot confirms a negative relationship between total factor productivity levels and labour informality rates for a sample of 30 developing countries. The interactive circles shows how high levels of labour informality are - on average - strongly associated with a vicious circle of low productivity and limited tax collection (and Peru is no exception).

            <h2>Informality has many faces in Peru </h2>
            <p>
           Using microdata from the National Household Survey of the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics, I developed these radial and ranged dot plots to characterise the informal labour market in Peru. The Stata code used for these calculations can be found in the Github repository.
           As can be seen from the graphs, most informal workers are self-employed and, on average, have the lowest wage levels compared to other occupational categories. According to these figures, informal self-employed workers have a wage level that is 42% below the average labour income in Peru. This reflects their low level of productivity and also highlights the high vulnerability they face in potential situations of unemployment or economic slowdown.

            <h2> High social security costs are a barrier to formalisation for low-income workers </h2>
            <p>
           In Peru, the interaction between a high minimum wage and minimum contributions to social security programmes - 9% of salary for health, paid by the employer, and 13% for pensions, paid by the worker - results in high formalisation costs for informal workers at the bottom of the income distribution.
           The following graph shows that for a worker earning the average wage of the first income decile, the cost of social security contributions can be as high as 174% of his or her labour income, creating strong disincentives to formalise.

            <h2>Regional pathways to formalisation </h2>
            <p>
           The interactive regional map below, with data from the last 15 years, shows that there is great heterogeneity in informality rates within Peru. These differences are quite marked between the regions of the central-south coast and those of the highlands and jungle. Moreover, these differences are persistent: Huancavelica was the region with the highest labour informality rate in 2007 and remained so at the end of 2023.
            </p>

            <figure id="Location2"></figure>

            <p>
           The regional differences in labour informality rates provide a source of empirical identification to explore policy options that could allow for greater formalisation in the future. One of these is to improve the level of training and certification of labour skills of informal workers in order to facilitate their access to more productive jobs. There is a strong correlation between levels of labour informality and the share of skilled workers at the regional level.
            </p>
            
            <figure id="Location6"></figure>

            <p>
          The other policy aspect relates to the tax and law enforcement capacity of different levels of government to formalise those workers and entrepreneurs operating outside the law. This reflects weak governance issues and the absence of business development services that facilitate the emergence of more productive activities at the regional level.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
Based on a combination of interactive charts at the national, regional and individual levels, it can be concluded that labour informality in Peru is a multidimensional problem that requires a significant redesign of the social protection system, the implementation of policies to strengthen human capital and an improvement in the enforcement capacity of the state. Unless this problem is reversed, Peru will continue to be trapped in a vicious circle of low productivity, missing the opportunity to achieve a more sustainable development path.            </p>
            </p>

         <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>
        All the data used to build the charts can be found in the Github repository. However, much of the data has been obtained from sources that are difficult to automate, such as microdata from household surveys. This aspect is an opportunity for improvement for future deliveries and studies. In this work I have prioritised the interactivity of the graphs and their analytical capacity to suggest answers to relevant public policy problems.            </p>
